# Project Setup

The initial boilerplate code for the project is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/iAmMrinal0/prestoByExample/releases/tag/v0.1) and to get started with the setup, run the following commands in your terminal:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ pulp build --to index.js
```

The final command compiles our PureScript code and writes it to `index.js` 

At this point, if you open the `index.html` file in your browser you will not see any output. This is what we will build up on in the next chapter.
